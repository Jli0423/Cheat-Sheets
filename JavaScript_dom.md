# Document Object Model (DOM) interactions in JS

## Basic Interaction
- `alert()`: pauses script until 'ok' is pressed(creates a modal)
- `prompt("text to show", <default input></default>)`: same as alert but *returns* the input value and allows extra text
- `confirm()`: same as alert *returns* a boolean (through 2 buttons of "ok" and "cancel") and allows text
- The styling and position of these modals are determined by browser


## Definitions
- Modal: visitor cannot interact with the rest of the page unless this component is dealt with
